                    <h4>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM OUR USERS?</h4>
                    <p class="lead animated">
                        The information we collect from you falls into two categories:
                        (i) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an
                        individual)
                        (“Personal Information”), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information
                        (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are)
                        (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will
                        tell you how we might collect and use each type. We do our best not to collect
                        any Personal Information from KeeperDapp users. That being said, when using our Services,
                        we do collect PUBlIC wallet addresses that you generate through KeeperDapp wallet.
                        Further, we may collect some Personal Information from you when you communicate with us,
                        including your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle,
                        or email address (depending on how you reach out). Like other online services,
                        we also collect a variety of Non-Personal Information, including:
                        Information you create through the KeeperDapp website or mobile applications,
                        including public wallet addresses. Various analytics data, such as: (i)
                        the IP address of the computer you use to access KeeperDapp ; (ii)
                        the type of browser software you are using; (iii) the operating system you are using;
                        (iv) the date and time you access or use KeeperDapp ; (v) the website address,
                        if any, that linked you to KeeperDapp ; (vi) the website address,
                        if any, you leave our website and travel to; and (vii) other non-personally identifiable traffic
                        data.

                    <h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>
                    <p class="lead animated">
                        When You Contact Us. We may collect certain information
                        if you choose to contact us, if you use our Services or if you report a bug or other error with

                        wallet address.

                        Users who visit our website or use our application may have their device’s IP address logged for
                        the purpose of generating anonymous statistics or troubleshooting the performance of our web
                        servers. Your IP address will not be used to track or identify you, but may be used to determine
                        your geographic location in order to determine which of our services you are presented with.
                        Users of our website or mobile applications will receive an anonymous unique device id (“UDID”)
                        for the purpose of identifying the device to KeeperDapp servers. This UDID will not be tied to
                        users’ identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when
                        users access our Services using multiple devices.

                        through the KeeperDapp application cannot be deleted from the Ethereum blockchain, therefore we
                        are unable to delete this personal information. If at any point you wish for KeeperDapp to
                        delete information about you, you may contact us at info@keeperdapp.io

                    <h4>DATA SECURITY</h4>
                    <p class="lead animated">
                        We are committed to making sure your information is protected and have selected third-party
                        vendors which use the Ethereum network, including Coinbase, Shapeshift, Changelly, and as well

                        do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security. We employ
                        several physical and electronic safeguards to keep your information safe, including encrypted
                        user passwords, two factor verification and authentication on passwords where possible, and
                        securing all connections with industry standard transport layer security. Even with all these

                        age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information
                        that you provide us while using KeeperDapp on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information
                        as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information
                        practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used
                        KeeperDapp, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at
                        info@keeperdapp.io
                    </p>
                    <h4>ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h4>
                    <p class="lead animated">
                        Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to
                        deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari,
                        Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature
                        that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and
                        behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service
                        may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all
                        browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes
                        a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including Trust Wallet, do not take
                        action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit
                        http://allaboutdnt.com. Tracking Technologies Generally
                        Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most
                        commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
                        For more information, please see the section entitled “Cookies Policy” below.

                        A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server.
                        Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
                        cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select
                        certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each
                        cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list periodically, so there may
                        be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the
                        Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign
                        effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive
                        reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an
                        individual and aggregated basis.
